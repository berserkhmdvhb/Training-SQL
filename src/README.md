# ðŸ§  Advanced SQL Join Scenarios: Real-World Use Cases

This tutorial covers advanced SQL join patterns derived from real-world business and data engineering use cases. Each example includes a description, practical scenario, and optimized SQL query.

## 1. Injecting Manager Information (Self-Join)

Suppose we have an `identities` table that stores employee details (`emp_id`, `emp_name`, `emp_mail`, etc.). Each employee may have a `emp_manager_id` referencing another employee.

We want to include each employeeâ€™s own details along with their managerâ€™s name and email:

```sql
SELECT
    e.emp_id,
    e.emp_name,
    e.emp_mail,
    m.emp_id AS manager_id,
    m.emp_name AS manager_name,
    m.emp_mail AS manager_email
FROM
    identities e
LEFT JOIN
    identities m
    ON e.emp_manager_id = m.emp_id;
```

---

## 2. Join a View with a Superset Table (Partial Coverage Case)

- `identities`: full table of employees
- `vw_employees`: view containing a filtered subset (e.g., active employees)
- Some `emp_manager_id`s in the view refer to managers not present in the view

Join the view with the full table to retrieve missing manager details:

```sql
SELECT
    v.emp_id,
    v.emp_name,
    v.emp_mail,
    v.emp_manager_id,
    m.emp_name AS manager_name,
    m.emp_mail AS manager_email
FROM
    vw_employees v
LEFT JOIN
    identities m
    ON v.emp_manager_id = m.emp_id;
```

---

## 3. Find Unmatched Rows (Anti-Join Pattern)

Return rows in `ods_table` that have no match in `keys_lookup`:

```sql
SELECT o.*
FROM ods_table o
LEFT JOIN keys_lookup k
    ON o.key = k.key
WHERE k.key IS NULL;
```

ðŸ“Œ `o.key IS NULL` would instead return rows where the key itself is NULL in the source table â€” not the same thing.

---

## 4. Capture Missing History (CDC + Anti-Join)

Use case: populate `DatelessAccounts` with rows from `identities` where `changedate IS NULL` **and** they donâ€™t already exist in the destination.

```sql
WITH datelessaccs AS (
    SELECT id
    FROM identities
    WHERE changedate IS NULL
),
cdc AS (
    SELECT v.id, GETDATE() AS insertdate
    FROM datelessaccs v
    LEFT JOIN DatelessAccounts t ON v.id = t.id
    WHERE t.id IS NULL
)
-- INSERT INTO DatelessAccounts (id, insertdate)
-- SELECT * FROM cdc;
```

---

## 5. Hierarchical Join (Multi-Level Reporting)

Build a 2-level hierarchy: employee â†’ manager â†’ senior manager.

```sql
SELECT
    e.emp_name AS employee,
    m.emp_name AS manager,
    sm.emp_name AS senior_manager
FROM
    identities e
LEFT JOIN identities m ON e.emp_manager_id = m.emp_id
LEFT JOIN identities sm ON m.emp_manager_id = sm.emp_id;
```

---

## 6. Detect Duplicate Join Results (Exploding Rows)

Sometimes joins unintentionally multiply rows. Use these two methods to detect it.

### Approach 1: Aggregate and Filter

```sql
SELECT e.emp_id, COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM identities e
JOIN payrolls p ON e.emp_id = p.emp_id
GROUP BY e.emp_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### Approach 2: Window Functions

```sql
WITH duplicates AS (
    SELECT
        e.emp_id,
        COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY e.emp_id) AS match_count,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY e.emp_id ORDER BY p.pay_date DESC) AS rn
    FROM identities e
    JOIN payrolls p ON e.emp_id = p.emp_id
)
SELECT *
FROM duplicates
WHERE match_count > 1;
```

---

## 7. Get Latest Record per Group (CDC / Audit Log)

Use `ROW_NUMBER()` to get the most recent update per employee:

```sql
WITH ranked_changes AS (
    SELECT *,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY emp_id ORDER BY changedate DESC) AS rn
    FROM identities_audit
)
SELECT *
FROM ranked_changes
WHERE rn = 1;
```

## âœ… Summary of Join Techniques

| Scenario | Join Type | Pattern |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Self-Referencing (Managers) | Self-Join | `LEFT JOIN identities m ON e.emp_manager_id = m.emp_id` |
| View â†’ Full Table | Left Join | Use full table for unmatched manager IDs |
| Find Missing Keys | Anti-Join | `LEFT JOIN ... WHERE other.key IS NULL` |
| Detect Duplicates | Join + Aggregation or Window | `COUNT(*)` + `GROUP BY` or `ROW_NUMBER()` |
| Latest Change | Window Function | `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY ...)` |
